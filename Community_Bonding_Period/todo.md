### Plan :  
The Community Bonding Period is dedicated for the Contributor to get familiar with the Organization's workflow and contributing guidelines. I have contributed to Metasploit previously, so I have a good idea about the codebase and workflow. My previous contributions have equally ranged among creating issues, creating PRs, and reviewing PRs of fellow contributors.  
  
Thus, my plan for this period would be to work on suggestion features and fix bugs which preferentially are related to the HTTP-Trace feature (my GSoC project).  
  
### Work Done :  
* Successfully setup the Development Environment.  
* Worked on some bug fixes to get familiar with codebase.  
* Fixed Meeting times with my Mentor (Twice a Week).  
* Fixed work strategies and evaluation guidelines with my Mentor.  
  
### To-Do :  
* Work on bugs (or report new ones) that streamline to my GSoC project.  
* Work on my Open PRs to get them merged.  
* Update my Blog with to track my work every week for the Summer.
